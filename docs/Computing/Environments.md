# Environments

# `conda`

To set up a conda environment we suggest that your first increase your AFS quota, by following [this](https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Help/?kbid=067040) guide.

If you still require more space. i.e `/afs/cern.ch/user/<initial>/<username>` is filling up, you can point `conda` to the work directory `/afs/cern.ch/work/<initial>/<username>`
